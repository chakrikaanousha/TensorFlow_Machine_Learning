This repository contains a simple TensorFlow project that serves as the "Hello World" of Machine Learning using Google Cloud.

Machine Learning Algorithm: NEURAL NETWORK

## Steps Followed

1. **Importing Necessary Packages:**

   - TensorFlow: Used for training and evaluating the model.
   - NumPy: Used to represent the data.

2. **Prepare the Data:**

   - The data is represented in the form of an array.

3. **Design the Model:**

   - Machine Learning Algorithm Used: Neural Network with 1 layer and 1 neuron.
   - The network takes only one input at a time.
   - Input shape: [1]

4. **Compile the Model:**

   - Keras is used to compile the model.
   - Loss function: Mean Square Method.
   - Optimizer: Stochastic Gradient Descent.

5. **Train the Model:**

   - The model is trained for a specified number of epochs.

6. **Test the Model:**

   - The model is tested by providing input data.
